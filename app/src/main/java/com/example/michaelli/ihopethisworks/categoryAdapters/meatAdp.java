Corned beef is safe once the internal temperature has reached at least 145 째F (62.8 째C) with a three minute rest time, but cooking it longer will make it fork-tender. Corned beef may still be pink in color after cooking. This does not mean it is not done. Nitrite is used in the curing process. This fixes pigment in the meat and affects the color."
